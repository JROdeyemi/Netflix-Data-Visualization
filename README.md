# Netflix-Data-Visualization
In this project, I answered three major business questions;
  1. Is our platform family friendly or should kids be protected from the content?
  2. Is our platform biased towards movies or series?
  3. Does our platform promote cultural diversity or have we been serving only Americans?
  
You will find answers to these questions in this visualization.
